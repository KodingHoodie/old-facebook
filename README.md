Facebook Clone (HTML & CSS)
This is a basic static clone of the classic Facebook layout, built using only HTML and CSS. It was originally created during my early learning days with CodingPhase as a practice project.

ðŸ”¹ No frameworks
ðŸ”¹ Built with floats, clear: both;, and old-school layout techniques
ðŸ”¹ Not responsive â€” desktop-only

Purpose
This project was part of my early journey into web development. It helped me understand layout fundamentals, positioning, and working with traditional CSS methods before learning modern tools like Flexbox and Grid.
